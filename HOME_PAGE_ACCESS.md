# 🏠 How to Access Your Property Management Pulse Home Page

## 🚨 Current Issue: 404 Page Not Found

You're seeing a 404 error because GitHub Pages isn't serving the main application properly.

### ✅ **Quick Fixes:**

#### **Option 1: Direct URL Access**
Try accessing the home page directly:
```
https://jacquim.github.io/PropManPulse/
```

#### **Option 2: Force Refresh**
1. Go to: `https://jacquim.github.io/PropManPulse/`
2. Press `Ctrl + F5` (Windows) or `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac) to force refresh
3. Clear browser cache if needed

#### **Option 3: Wait for Deployment**
The deployment might still be in progress. Check:
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click "Actions" tab
3. Wait for the green checkmark ✅

### 🔧 **What I've Fixed:**

1. **Added 404.html handling** for Single Page Application routing
2. **Created fallback logo** (SVG) in case PNG isn't uploaded yet
3. **Updated build process** to copy necessary files
4. **Enhanced deployment workflow** with better error handling

### 🎯 **Expected Home Page Features:**

Once working, you'll see:
- ✅ **Navigation bar** with your logo
- ✅ **Auto-login** (demo mode)
- ✅ **Property Management Dashboard** with:
  - Stats cards (properties, tenants, tickets)
  - Recent activities
  - Upcoming inspections
  - Quick actions

### 📱 **Demo Mode Features:**

The app automatically logs you in as a demo user with access to:
- **Community Management**
- **Rental Management** 
- **Maintenance & Inspections**
- **Compliance & Governance**

### 🚀 **If Still Not Working:**

1. **Check deployment status** in GitHub Actions
2. **Try the direct URL** with trailing slash: `/PropManPulse/`
3. **Clear browser cache** completely
4. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for GitHub Pages to update

### 📞 **Next Steps:**

1. Commit and push the fixes I made
2. Wait for deployment to complete
3. Access the site at the correct URL
4. Add your actual logo PNG file to replace the placeholder

Your Property Management Pulse application should be accessible once the deployment completes! 🎉
